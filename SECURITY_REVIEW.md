## Critical

### 1. ~~Suspicious exfiltration code in `tickets.ts`~~ — RESOLVED

**Root cause identified and all blocks removed.**

The `#region agent log` blocks were instrumentation injected by the `webapp-testing` Claude Code agent skill during development sessions. The skill instruments code with telemetry to test runtime hypotheses. They were never cleaned up and got committed.

**Affected files (all cleaned):**
- `backend/src/routes/tickets.ts` — sent `suppliersIdAssign` and pagination params to port 7903
- `admin_frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx` — sent **admin email addresses** on every login attempt to port 7713
- `admin_frontend/src/pages/TwoFactorChallenge.tsx` — sent 2FA flow state to port 7713
- `admin_frontend/src/pages/EmailOtpChallenge.tsx` — sent OTP flow state to port 7713

The targets were `127.0.0.1` (localhost), so no data was sent to external servers. In production the calls failed silently. However, during development sessions where the agent skill listener was running, **admin email addresses were exposed on every login**. All blocks have been removed and verified clean.

### 2. CORS is wide open
**File:** `backend/src/index.ts` line 27

`app.use(cors())` with no configuration accepts requests from any origin. `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` is documented in `.env.example` and `CLAUDE.md` but is never passed to the cors() call.

**Fix:** Pass the allowed origins list:
```ts
app.use(cors({ origin: process.env.TRUSTED_ORIGINS?.split(',') }));
```

---

### 3. No TLS
**File:** `nginx/nginx.conf`

NGINX only listens on port 80 and 8080. Port 443 is mentioned in `CLAUDE.md` but there is no server block for it. All traffic — sessions, JWTs, credentials — is unencrypted in transit.

**Fix:** Add a TLS server block in nginx.conf, or terminate TLS at a load balancer / reverse proxy upstream of NGINX. HSTS should be added once TLS is in place.

---

### 4. Old tickets route still accessible
**File:** `backend/src/routes/tickets.ts`

`POST /api/tickets/graphql` accepts `suppliersIdAssign` directly from the request body. Any user with a valid JWT can query **any supplier's tickets** by supplying an arbitrary ID. The new org-scoped route (`POST /api/orgs/:orgId/proxy/tickets`) fixes the frontend, but the old route remains a privilege escalation vector.

**Fix:** Remove or disable `backend/src/routes/tickets.ts` and its registration in `index.ts`, or at minimum enforce that `suppliersIdAssign` matches the caller's org `externalReferenceId`.

---

## High

### 5. Admin auth is a single shared secret with no identity
**File:** `backend/src/middleware/adminAuth.ts`

The entire `/api/admin` prefix is excluded from `jwtAuth` (see `PUBLIC_ROUTES` in `jwtAuth.ts`). Admin routes are protected only by checking `x-admin-secret` against an env var — a static shared secret. There is:
- No rate limiting or lockout on failed attempts
- No IP restriction
- No user identity attached — audit logs for admin actions are anonymous
- No JWT context, so you cannot know which person performed an admin action

**Fix:** Require a valid JWT in addition to the admin secret, or replace the secret with a dedicated admin role enforced by `jwtAuth`. Add audit logging for every admin action.

---

### 6. `externalReferenceId` injected into GraphQL query without validation
**Files:** `backend/src/routes/organizationResources.ts` (supplier and tickets proxy routes)

```ts
const supplierId = org.externalReferenceId;
const query = `... suppliers_id_assign: ${supplierId} ...`;
```

`externalReferenceId` is a free-form `String?` column. If it contains GraphQL metacharacters (e.g. `1} { __schema`), this is a GraphQL injection. The value comes from the database but was originally set via an admin or seeding operation — any path that writes it should be treated as untrusted.

**Fix:** Before interpolation, assert the value is a valid integer:
```ts
const supplierId = parseInt(org.externalReferenceId, 10);
if (isNaN(supplierId)) {
  res.status(403).json({ error: 'Organization has no valid supplier reference' });
  return;
}
```

---

### 7. 2FA backup codes and OTP values stored in plaintext
**Schema:** `TwoFactor.backupCodes` (`String`), `Verification.value` (`String`)

Both are stored as plain text in the database. If the database is compromised, all 2FA backup codes are immediately usable and all pending OTP codes are readable.

**Fix:** Hash backup codes with bcrypt before storing. For OTPs, store only a hash and compare on verification.

---

### 8. No rate limiting
There is no rate limiting on any endpoint. The most exposed surfaces:
- `POST /api/auth/token` — JWT issuance, brute-forceable credentials
- `POST /api/auth/` — login flow
- Proxy endpoints — can exhaust external API quotas

**Fix:** Add `express-rate-limit` at minimum on auth routes. Consider per-IP and per-user limits on proxy endpoints.

---

## Medium

### 9. Two overlapping, uncoordinated RBAC systems
The app has two independent access control layers that every new route must satisfy:

| System | Where | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| `Role` / `RoleEndpointMapping` | Endpoint level | `jwtAuth` middleware |
| `MemberRole` (OWNER/ADMIN/MANAGER/VIEWER) | Org membership level | `checkOrganizationAccess()` |

These are not coordinated. Granting access to a new org-scoped route requires correctly updating two separate tables. It is easy to grant one and forget the other. The mental model for "can this user do this?" spans two different DB queries with different logic.

**Investigate:** Decide whether endpoint-level RBAC is necessary in addition to org-level RBAC, or whether one system can be simplified away.

---

### 10. RBAC DB query on every request, no caching
**File:** `backend/src/services/rbacService.ts`

`hasRoleAccess()` queries `RoleEndpointMapping` on every single request. Role assignments change infrequently, but this adds a DB round-trip to every API call. Under load this becomes a latency bottleneck and unnecessary DB pressure.

**Fix:** Cache the role-to-endpoint mapping in memory (e.g. a `Map` populated at startup, invalidated when roles change via an admin action).

---

### 11. Missing security headers in NGINX
**File:** `nginx/nginx.conf`

Current headers: `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`.

Missing:
- `Content-Security-Policy` — primary XSS defense in modern browsers
- `Strict-Transport-Security` — enforces HTTPS (add after TLS is in place)
- `Referrer-Policy` — prevents leaking URLs in referer headers
- `Permissions-Policy` — restricts access to browser APIs

Note: `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` is deprecated and ignored by modern browsers. CSP replaces it.

---

### 12. `AuditLog.userId` is not a foreign key
**Schema:** `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`

```prisma
model AuditLog {
  userId String?  // no @relation to User
}
```

There is no referential integrity between `AuditLog` and `User`. Deleting a user silently orphans their audit records with no cascade or restriction. You cannot join from audit logs to users at the DB level. For a security audit trail this is a meaningful gap.

**Fix:** Add a `@relation` with `onDelete: SetNull` (to preserve the log while clearing the user reference) or keep the current nullable field but add a DB-level foreign key constraint.

---

### 13. Swagger UI is publicly accessible
**File:** `backend/src/index.ts` line 32

`/api/docs` is in `PUBLIC_ROUTES` and requires no authentication. Attackers can enumerate all endpoints, parameters, and response schemas without credentials.

**Fix:** In production, either remove the route or gate it behind the admin secret or a JWT.

---

## Low / Investigate

### 14. JWT refresh mechanism
The backend issues JWTs for component-level API calls (`/api/auth/token`), but there is no visible refresh token endpoint or rotation logic in the codebase. Clarify:
- What is the JWT expiry duration?
- How does the frontend get a new token after expiry?
- Is the user silently logged out, or is there a silent refresh?

Long-lived JWTs are a security risk. Short-lived JWTs without refresh cause UX problems.

---

### 15. No request body size limit
**File:** `backend/src/index.ts` line 28

`app.use(express.json())` with no `limit` option defaults to 100kb but this should be made explicit. The 90-second `proxy_read_timeout` in NGINX combined with unconstrained body sizes creates a surface for memory exhaustion or slow-body attacks.

**Fix:**
```ts
app.use(express.json({ limit: '50kb' }));
```
Reduce NGINX `proxy_read_timeout` to a value appropriate for your API (e.g. 30s).

---

### 16. `X-Forwarded-For` without trusted proxy configuration
**File:** `nginx/nginx.conf`

NGINX passes `$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for` but there is no `set_real_ip_from` / `real_ip_header` configuration. If a CDN or load balancer sits in front of NGINX, the IP addresses in this header can be spoofed by clients. Any IP-based logic (rate limiting, audit logging, geo-restrictions) would be unreliable.
